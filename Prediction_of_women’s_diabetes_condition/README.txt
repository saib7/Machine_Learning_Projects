# Prediction of Women's Diabetes Condition With Machine Learning Algorithms

Diabetes is a refractory condition that could lead to a global healthcare disaster. The detrimental effects of diabetes are currently affecting a sizeable section of the population worldwide, and many of these individuals especially women are not being properly diagnosed. Diabetics may eventually develop significant health issues such as nerve damage, blindness, kidney failure, and heart failure. Statistics say, 382 million people worldwide have diabetes which will double to 592 million by 2035.


The diagnosis of diabetes can be made using a variety of conventional techniques based on macroscopic level and microscopic level examinations. However, because of the intricate interplay of numerous factors, early diabetes prediction is a challenging assignment for medical professionals. Data science methodologies have the potential to advance other scientific disciplines. To assist in making predictions based on medical data is one such endeavor. Data science has an emerging topic called machine learning that studies how machines learn from experience. The goal of this project is to create a system that can accurately forecast a patientâ€™s risk of developing diabetes by applying four different supervised machine learning techniques: Support vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoost classifier.
