Diabetes is a refractory condition that could lead to a
global health care disaster. The detrimental effects of diabetes are
currently affecting a sizeable section of the population worldwide,
and many of these individuals especially women are not being
properly diagnosed. Diabetics may eventually develop major
health issues such as nerve damage, blindness, kidney failure,
and heart failure. Statistics says, 382 million people worldwide
have diabetes which will double to 592 million by 2035.
The diagnosis of diabetes can be made using a variety of conventional
techniques based on macroscopic level and microscopic
level examinations. However, because of the intricate interplay
of numerous factors, early diabetes prediction is a difficult
assignment for medical professionals. Data science methodologies
have the potential to advance other scientific disciplines. To
assist in making predictions based on medical data is one such
endeavor. Data science has an emerging topic called machine
learning that studies how machines learn from experience. The
goal of this project is to create a system that can accurately
forecast a patientâ€™s risk of developing diabetes by applying four
different supervised machine learning techniques, and they are:
Support vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forrest
and AdaBoost classifier.
